It is suitable for college and community league since it can be hosted free on a number of place.

## Getting Started (TODO: Refine)

* install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (More basic tutorials follow Jekyll)
* `bundle install`
* generate the site by running `bundle exec jekyll serve` during development.
* build the site by running `bundle exec jekyll build` before publish.
* init git in `_site` folder, push to the `gh_page` branch on github to host
    * github cannot automatically built since we use customized jekyll plugin.


## Add your data

All league data (matches, squad, etc.) goes under `_data` folder. All static assets (photos, images) better goes under `assets`.

### _data folder structures

    - seasons
        - 2018-2019
            - config.json (optional, default to League table style)

                * dortmund.json
            - games
